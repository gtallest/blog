WILT from interview prepping on Interview Cake.

`Greedy solutions` iterate through an input and take the best solution "so far" until reaching the end.

The `greedy approach` is only best if the solution can be reached by combining optimal solutions to subproblems, ending with an optimal solution.

A `greedy solution` is fast, but may not work on every problem.

Trying the `greedy approach` should be on of the first ways to tackle a new problem.

Sometimes a `greedy approach` will require more than one pass through the input.


Another good way to approach a problem is to try a brute force solution, then improving upon that. Try to look for any patterns or repeated work, then see if it's possible to minimize the repeated work and try to do it only once.
